This repository presents further techniques of object oriented programming and problem solving, with emphasis on abstraction and data structures. 
Topics include: object oriented concepts, such as, composition, inheritance, polymorphism, information hiding, and interfaces; 
basic program design and correctness, such as, abstract data types, preconditions and post conditions, assertions and loop invariants, testing, basic exception handling, and the application of algorithm design techniques.
