Implement a stack using linked lists. Then, use the implemented class to solve the problem of evaluating a fully parenthesized expression that we have seen in class. 

A fully parenthesized expression is an arithmetic expression where each operator is surrounded by two operands and two parentheses. For example, the following are fully parenthesized expressions:   ((9+7)*6), ((5-3)+(9-8)), (((9+8)-(9*7))-(7+2)). you may assume that all numbers are positive integers and that the expression contains the following operators only: +, -, *, /, %. Your code should work with all possible integers.
